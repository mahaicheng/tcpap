 * simulation software has been funded in part by the German Research 
 * Council (DFG). A detailed description of TCP-AP and a comparative 
 * performance study is given in:

 * Pacing for Multihop Wireless Networks, Proc. ACM
 * International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and
 * Computing (MobiHoc 2005), Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA, May 2005.
 *
 * This implementation of TCP-AP is based on TCP NewReno.
